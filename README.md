It's a Chrome extension that allows developers to keep track of their life's variables.

I've always wanted to create a Chrome extension to keep track of a few things [in key-value format]. So, I created this, it saves things [name/Variable] and their value.

I've created a custom right-click menu by which We can Update and delete our Variable and their values.

I've deployed it on Chrome web store for everyone to use it. And I'm also planning to add many more new features to it.

You can check out the Live Link to see the Project.
